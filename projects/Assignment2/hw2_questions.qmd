## Blueprinty Case Study

### Introduction

Blueprinty is a small firm that makes software for developing blueprints specifically for submitting patent applications to the US patent office. Their marketing team would like to make the claim that patent applicants using Blueprinty's software are more successful in getting their patent applications approved. Ideal data to study such an effect might include the success rate of patent applications before using Blueprinty's software and after using it. unfortunately, such data is not available. 

However, Blueprinty has collected data on 1,500 mature (non-startup) engineering firms. The data include each firm's number of patents awarded over the last 5 years, regional location, age since incorporation, and whether or not the firm uses Blueprinty's software. The marketing team would like to use this data to make the claim that firms using Blueprinty's software are more successful in getting their patent applications approved.

## AirBnB Case Study

### Introduction

AirBnB is a popular platform for booking short-term rentals. In March 2017, students Annika Awad, Evan Lebo, and Anna Linden scraped of 40,000 Airbnb listings from New York City.  The data include the following variables:

:::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### Variable Definitions

    - `id` = unique ID number for each unit
    - `last_scraped` = date when information scraped
    - `host_since` = date when host first listed the unit on Airbnb
    - `days` = `last_scraped` - `host_since` = number of days the unit has been listed
    - `room_type` = Entire home/apt., Private room, or Shared room
    - `bathrooms` = number of bathrooms
    - `bedrooms` = number of bedrooms
    - `price` = price per night (dollars)
    - `number_of_reviews` = number of reviews for the unit on Airbnb
    - `review_scores_cleanliness` = a cleanliness score from reviews (1-10)
    - `review_scores_location` = a "quality of location" score from reviews (1-10)
    - `review_scores_value` = a "quality of value" score from reviews (1-10)
    - `instant_bookable` = "t" if instantly bookable, "f" if not
